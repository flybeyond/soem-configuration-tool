INSTRUCTION: 

to create your own buffer string from an xml file UNDER WINDOWS	you have to:
 -install perl
 - put your xml file in a folder named "fs". this folder must be in the same directory of makefsdata
 -open DOS prompt
 -go to the directory that include makefsdata and "fs" folder
 -digit: perl makefsdata.pl
 -now there's a file called "fsdata.c" that contains your buffer
 -open "fsdata.c" with a text editor and:
    1)rename the structure as "data_xmlprova_xml"
    2)delete the first line (the one between /*File:...  and /*here starts the data*/)
    3)delete the last lines(const struct... , #define FS_ROOT file_beckhoff_xml and #define FS_NUMFILES 1) 

(compare your file that has been generated with xmlprova_example to see the differences)
